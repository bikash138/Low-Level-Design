So out question says to design a system like Zomato which will have the following functional requirements:
 - User can search location based on location
 - User can add items to cart
 - User can checkout by making payment
 - User should be notified onece placed is successfully

Non-functional requirements:
 - Each part of the system should be scalable and modifiable

It is also given that we have to focus on the user centeric features. We need not focus on the delivery partner realated features.

So in the system the user can place two types of orders:
 - Pickup orders
 - Delivery orders

Keep in mind to create the UML dieagram before diving into coding part otherwise it will be very difficult to visualize the system.

So in this question we will be using the bottom up approach.
