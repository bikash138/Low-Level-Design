# Abstraction

## What is Abstraction?
It is a way to hide inner complexity of any system and expose only the essential features to the user.

## Types of Classes

### Concrete classes
Concrete classes are normal classes which has methods with bodies, variables and can be instantiated (can be created into objects).

### Abstract classes
Abstract classes are the classes which has variables and methods but it definitely has one pure virtual method. It cannot be instantiated (object cannot be created out of it).

## Interface
Interface is a special type of abstract class which have only virtual methods. It means it cannot contains any variables and full body methods.

### Points to Note
- In C++ there is no keyword like `interface` so it is implemented using the abstract class.
- But In Java there exists `interface` keyword.
